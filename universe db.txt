Instructions
For this project, you need to log in to PostgreSQL:
psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres in the terminal. 

Notes:
If you leave your virtual machine, your database may not be saved. You can make a dump of it by entering pg_dump -cC --inserts -U freecodecamp universe > universe.sql in a bash terminal (not the psql one). It will save the commands to rebuild your database in universe.sql. The file will be located where the command was entered. If it's anything inside the project folder, the file will be saved in the VM. You can rebuild the database by entering psql -U postgres < universe.sql in a terminal where the .sql file is.

If you are saving your progress on freeCodeCamp.org, after getting all the tests to pass, follow the instructions above to save a dump of your database. Save the universe.sql file in a public repository and submit the URL to it on freeCodeCamp.org.

You should use the INT data type for at least two columns that are not a primary or foreign key.

Astronomers estimate that there is roughly one exoplanet per star in our galaxy. Of course, some stars have many planets â€“ our own Sun has eight. And some stars have none. But if a star lives long enough, forming planets seems to be the rule, rather than the exception. https://astronomy.com/news/2020/02/how-many-planets-are-there-in-the-universe
