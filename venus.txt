star_id = 1

namesake: Venus, the third brightest object after the Sun and Moon, was named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.

description: It's a cloud-swaddled planet named for a love goddess. Venus is often called "Earth’s twin" because they’re similar in size and structure, but Venus has extreme surface heat and a dense, toxic atmosphere.

pop_culture: Because it’s so bright and easy to see in the sky, Venus has played a role in popular culture since ancient times, inspiring writing and song: It was called the most beautiful star in the sky by Homer, author of "The Iliad" and "The Odyssey" – two of the oldest and most important works in Greek literature.
